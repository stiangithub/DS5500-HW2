## Problem 2
I choose Thomas Carpenito's visualization.[Link](https://github.com/Tommyixi/DS-5500-Homework/tree/master/HW1). Generally speaking, this visualization effectively visualize the distribution of income across countries. You can see income distribution across the world for different years. This one is pretty different with mine, as mine is static line plot, while his is dynamic map-form visualization which is very fancy. However, when talking about is it easy to interpret, his work needs some improvements. First, his visualization shows a general picture of GDP per capita all over the world. But his visualization only has 7 levels of GDP, namely 0 to 60000. You can only tell that a country belongs to a certain level and don't a exact number. Second, the color he chose need to be more distinguishable. I mean if you look at this plot, the entire Eurasia & African continent seems to be all blue, except for some pink in western Europe. Maybe changing the color would help to interpret more easily.
